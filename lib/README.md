This is just another replication of the Flappy Bird game. However, the main protagonist of this game will be Orpheus today. He will be flying from place to place and conquer the world.
The rules of the game are quite simple, it is exactly the same as with the flappy bird game. Try to avoid the columns and gain points by pressing the space bar to jump!!! Hope y'all will like it.
